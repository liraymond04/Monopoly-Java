# My Personal Project: Monopoly

## About

This is a **Java** clone of *Monopoly* created for a CPSC 210 project based
on the [official rule-set](https://www.officialgamerules.org/monopoly).
Monopoly is a turn-based multiplayer board game, where the objective
of the game is to not go bankrupt and outlive the other players by
acquiring properties and collecting rent.

## Who is this for?

*Monopoly* is a fun game that can be played with friends and family, its
combination of strategy and luck makes it simultaneously engaging and
accessible to a wide variety of people. This project aims to bring the
Monopoly experience to players as a cross-platform desktop application.

## Why Monopoly?

As a player of the official PC port of *MONOPOLYÂ® PLUS* from Ubisoft,
I was frustrated with many of the user interface choices, such as:
- Only being able to change transaction values by 1, making inputting
large values difficult
- Unclear controls for how to select properties to exchange during trades

Many of these issues with the user interface are due to the game being designed
for gamepad controllers. This usually makes the game unintuitive and unplayable
for desktop users, most of whom use mouse and keyboard to play.

As a project for CPSC 210, I think Monopoly is a decently complex game that
will be interesting to design and implement, and is achievable within my
limits as a programmer.
